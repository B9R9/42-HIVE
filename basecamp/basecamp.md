### BASECAMP (July 2021)  

For 1 month, we learn c languages through daily exercises. The answers are shared between students but the most important thing is to understand what you are doing.
 There is no obligation to pass all the exercises or even to finish all the exercises. It is important to strike a balance between quality and quantity.
 The swimming pool takes place every day of the week. It is therefore also important to have a rhythm in order to be able to follow. The final mark does
 not depend solely on your marks in the exercises. So you can skip any day and still get caught. The hardest thing is not to let yourself be overwhelmed
 by the exercises, to know how to ask for help, and to make yourself available to others.
