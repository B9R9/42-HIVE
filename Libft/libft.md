### Introduction
The libft project builds on the concepts you learned during Day-06 of the Picsine ie code a library of useful functions that you will 
be allowed to reuse in most of your C projects this year. This will save you a lot of precious time.
The following assignments will have you write lines of code you already wrote during the Piscine.
See the libft project as a Piscine reminder and use it wisely to assess your level and progress.
***
## Objectives
C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful standard functions.
This project makes you to take the time to re-write those functions, understand them, and learn to use them.
This library will help you for all your future C projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions with your own.
Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.
***
## Installation
***
I made the choice to centralize all Hive projects in a single file.
This does not allow you to download the libft individually at the moment.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:B9R9/42-HIVE.git
$ cd ../path/to/the/folder/libft
$ make
```
***
## Compilation
During the compilation use:
```
$ -I ./libft/includes
$ -L ./libft/ -lft
```

## Update
This project is permanent evolution:
> Clean double function
> Add more options for mini-printf
> write better code
