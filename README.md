### What is Hive?
  [Hive](www.hive.fi/en/about-hive/) is a new kind of coding school in Helsinki sponsored by Supercell, based on the revolutionary education model of the French school [Ecole 42](https://42.fr/).  
  We mainly learn the C language by exchanging with other students, browsing documentation or doing research on the internet. You learn how to be independent but also to work in a team. We improve our management of priorities and management of our time. You learn a lot about yourself and your motivation, your courage, and your frustrations.

### My Experience:
It was an incredible experience and a revelation. Coding and solving everyday problems is fun. School is demanding in terms of time and personal involvement. You have to be present every day. You cannot succeed without others. Hive makes it possible to exchange and conform to another point of view, which will allow me to grow even more.
